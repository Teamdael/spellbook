**3rd-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (alcohol or distilled spirits)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Necromantic energy emanates from you in a 30-foot radius area. Until the spell ends, the area moves with you, centered on you. While within the area, you and every creature that you have under your control (such as through an animate dead spell) gains 2d4 temporary hit points at the start of each of their turns. These temporary hit points last until they leave the area.

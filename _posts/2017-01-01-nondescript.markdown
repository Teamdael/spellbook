This spell makes you seem ordinary and nondescript to others, though it does not change your actual appearance. Creatures who see you while you were under the influence of this spell are unable to recall specific details of your appearance upon being asked if they had seen you or someone matching your description, though their memory of actions you undertook or events they experienced is unaffected.

**Evocation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 5 feet

**Components**: V, M (a weapon)

**Duration**: 1 round

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the attack does damage as normal, except that the entire attack deals cold damage instead of its normal type. Additionally, the target must make a Constitution saving throw or be covered in brittle frost. If the target is then hit again by an attack before the beginning of your next turn, the target takes an additional 1d8 cold damage.

At 5th level, the melee attack and secondary damage each deal an additional 1d8 cold damage to their targets. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8/3d8), and 17th level (3d8/4d8).

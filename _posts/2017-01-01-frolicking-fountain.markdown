**5th-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a conductor's baton)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause a 5-foot cube of water within range to animate in a hypnotic motion. The water swirls for the duration, not leaving its space except to send small jets up to five feet into the air. Each creature except for the caster within 60 feet which sees the fountain must make a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While charmed by this spell, a creature must use its movement on each of its turns to get as close to the water as possible. A charmed creature canâ€™t willingly move away from the fountain. At the end of its turn, a charmed creature can attempt the saving throw again, ending the effect on a success. Once a creature has succeeded on a save against this spell, it cannot be affected by the same instance of it again.

If a creature is within 5 feet of the dancing waters, you can use a bonus action to command the water to lash out at that creature. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the water deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage to the target. If the target is charmed by this spell, it can attempt the saving throw again after taking damage from it.

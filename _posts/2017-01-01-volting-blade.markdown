You speak the ancient words and call forth a bolt of lightning from the heavens and fashion it into a stormy blade. This magic sword lasts until the spell ends. It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. It deals 2d8 lightning damage on a hit and has the finesse, light, and thrown properties (range 20/60). In addition, when you are flying or in stormy weather, you make the attack roll with advantage.
If you drop the weapon, or throw it, it dissipates at the end of the turn. Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the sword to reappear in your hand.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, the damage increases to 3d8. When you cast it using a 5th or 6th-level spell slot, the damage increases to 4d8. When you cast it using a spell slot of 7th or higher, the damage increases to 5d8.

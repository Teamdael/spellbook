**2nd-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 5 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of chalk)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You outline a 5-foot diameter circle on the ground, which is warded against intruders. Only creatures you choose can step within the circle. Any ranged attack roll made against a target within the circle has disadvantage. If a hostile creature makes a melee attack against a target within the circle, the attacker is pushed back 10 feet immediately after the attack.

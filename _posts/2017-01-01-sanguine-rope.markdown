**2nd-level transmutation (hemomancy)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Varies (see below)

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You draw out a portion of your blood, forming it into a rope that you can use to either pull yourself to a location, or pull an object or creature to you. As you cast the spell, you must expend a number of hit points. Then, you immediately send the rope to grab a target that you can see within a range in feet equal to 5 times the number of hit points spent. Once you grab a target, you can either pull yourself to a location within 5 feet of the target, or you can attempt to pull the target to a location within 5 feet of you. In order to pull the target to you, it must weigh less than 100 pounds, and if it is a creature it can make a Strength saving throw to avoid being pulled. If you pull yourself to a target, you move in a straight line towards the target and take opportunity attacks as normal.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the amount of weight you can pull increases by 50 pounds for each slot level above 2nd.

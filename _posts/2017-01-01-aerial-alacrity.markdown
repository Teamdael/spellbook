**2nd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a feather from a bird of prey)

**Duration**: 10 minutes

Target a willing creature within range you can see that has a flying speed (including those with a temporary or magically-bestowed flying speed). That creature gains the following benefits for the duration:
• The target can take the Dash action as a bonus action.
• The target can hover.
• The target has advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
• The target doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach

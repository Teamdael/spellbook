**1st-level illusion**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a chameleon's tail)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You touch a willing creature and place a minor illusion on it that allows it to blend in with its surroundings. For the duration, that creature can replace its Dexterity (Stealth) modifier with your spell attack bonus on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes.

**1st-level necromancy (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a drop of blood)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Choose an unoccupied 20-foot square within range (note that the area must have solid earth beneath it; this spell fails if cast on the upper floor of a building). This spell then causes one pile of humanoid bones to rise out of the ground within that square. If you cast this spell within a burial place such as a graveyard, mausoleum or barrow, 1d4 piles of bones are exhumed instead of 1. The ground itself is not changed or disturbed by this spell; the bones simply appear out of the ground.

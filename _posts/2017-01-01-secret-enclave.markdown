**9th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a tiny, silver bell)

**Duration**: 10 minutes

You conjure a shimmering, multicolored portal, large enough to admit Large or smaller creatures, which connects to a pocket dimension, much like the demiplane spell. The enclave is a cube with 900 foot sides and behaves as if it were part of the Feywild. The floor is made of earth that is fertile but cannot be burrowed through. When the spell ends, the portal into the enclave disappears, but the portal exiting it remains, appearing as an ornate gateway that cannot be destroyed by any means.
As long as you are within an enclave that you originally created, you can freely control the weather inside it, as per the control weather spell.
You or anyone else can create another portal leading back to the enclave by casting this spell again. However, once an enclave has been created, its location is fixed, and the portal can only be opened from that same location (or from within the enclave). The location of a secret enclave cannot be detected by divination magic of any kind, though a wish spell can reveal the location of the nearest enclave.
You can create secret enclaves within secret enclaves, but only if the original enclave was created by you.

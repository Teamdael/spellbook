**Evocation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 5 feet

**Components**: V, M (a weapon)

**Duration**: 1 round

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the attack does damage as normal, except that the entire attack deals lightning damage instead of its normal type. Additionally, you can cause your lightning to jump to a creature within 5 feet of your target, dealing lightning damage equal to your spellcasting modifier.
At 5th level, the melee attack and secondary damage each deal an additional 1d8 lightning damage to their targets. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8), and 17th level (3d8).

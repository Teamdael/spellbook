**3rd-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (flake of skin or bone from an undead)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You touch a creature, transferring a virulent disease into their body. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 10d4 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can’t reduce a target’s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, it can’t take reactions for the next 10 minutes as the disease clouds their brain. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature to remove the secondary effect.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

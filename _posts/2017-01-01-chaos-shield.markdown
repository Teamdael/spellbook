**1st-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 8 hours

You ward yourself against chaotic energies. For the duration, whenever you generate a random magical effect through a wild magic surge, you can reroll the result. You must use the new result. Furthermore, you have advantage on any saving throw you are forced to make against any magical effects generated by such a roll (whether they were created by yourself or others).

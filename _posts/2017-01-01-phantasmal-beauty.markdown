**3rd-level illusion**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a bit of sponge)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the dreams of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its darkest desires, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes incapacitated and unable to move for the duration. In addition, it has disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks it makes. The target can repeat its saving throw against this spell when it takes damage, ending the spell on a success.

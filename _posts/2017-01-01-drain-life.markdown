**9th-level necromancy (hemomancy)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You open a deep wound on your body, draining the blood of another creature as your own blood leaves your body. As you cast the spell, you must expend a number of hit points. The creature must then make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 12d12 + double the number of hit points spent as necrotic damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one.

**Abjuration cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a specially prepared gauntlet worth at least 5 gp)

**Duration**: 1 minute

***Note: If taking this cantrip on a class other than warmage, discuss with me first.***

You summon a translucent, yet visible, field of force which springs forth from the prepared gauntlet. For the duration, you can wield this field of force as a shield, and you have proficiency with it.

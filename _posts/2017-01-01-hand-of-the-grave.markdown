**2nd-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: 10 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a hand of a humanoid)

**Duration**: 24 hours

When you cast this spell, you bury a humanoid hand into a patch of loose earth at least 5 feet in diameter to conceal it. The area is nearly undisturbed and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.

The hand animates when a medium or smaller creature walks over the area of earth. You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the spell could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the spell, such as those who say a certain password.

When the hand animates, it attempts to grab whatever creature triggered it. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained as it is pulled into the earth. When the creature is pulled into the earth, it has total cover and begins suffocating. At the start of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the creature escapes and the hand retracts back into the ground.

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered glass)

**Duration**: 1 minute

This spell distorts the rules of the universe in a short range around you, wreaking arcane havoc. For the duration, some damage types are exchanged with others, as shown on the table below.
Additionally, no creature within range can regain hit points due to magic. Instead, when a creature would regain hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw or takes necrotic damage equal to the amount it would have regained.

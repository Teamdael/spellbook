**2nd-level abjuration (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (an ounce of salt for each foot of the warded portal's perimeter)

**Duration**: 10 minutes

Tracing arcane sigils along its boundary, you can ward a doorway, window, or other portal from entry. For the duration, an invisible eldritch creature stalks the warded portal. Any creature that attempts to pass through the portal must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d6 psychic damage, or half as much on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Evocation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 5 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Spectral dragon claws appear around your hands ready to rend your foes. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 damage, and you choose whether the attack does acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage when you cast the spell. The spell allows you to make more than one attack when you reach higher levels: 2 attacks at 5th level, 3 attacks at 11th level, and 4 attacks at 17th level. You can make the attacks against the same target or different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each attack. All of your attacks deal the same damage type.

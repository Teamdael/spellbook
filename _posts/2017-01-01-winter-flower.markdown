**6th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a crystal flower)

**Duration**: 24 hours

You cause a Small white flower to grow in an unoccupied 5-foot square you can see within range. The flower has an AC of 15, 3 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage. During the duration of the spell, you can use a bonus action to command it to explode in a shower of ice. Alternatively, the flower will explode if it is reduced to 0 hit points. When the flower explodes, each creature within 30 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d8 cold damage, or half as much on a successful one. The flower withers and dies if it does not explode within 24 hours.

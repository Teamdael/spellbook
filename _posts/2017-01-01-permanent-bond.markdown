**8th-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Until dispelled

***NOTE:*** Unsure if I want to allow this spell, seems out of bounds.

You focus on a dragon that is at least one size category larger than you are, attempting to bond with it. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be permanently charmed by you, regarding you as if you were part of its family (which will have different meanings for different breeds of dragons). If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. A willing dragon can choose to fail the saving throw. While the dragon is charmed, it is bound to serve you as a mount in battle, which it does to the best of its ability.

You also have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence and as long as both of you are conscious, each of you can use this telepathic link to communicate with the other. The dragon knows that it is charmed by you and retains its personality and alignment while under the effects of this spell; for example, a good dragon might refuse to use its breath weapon on innocent civilians. The GM has the dragon's statistics. This spell ends if either party dies or if you attempt to bond with a different dragon.

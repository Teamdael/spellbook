**9th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Self (100-mile radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a crystal snowglobe worth at least 1.000 gp)

**Duration**: 180 days

You change the weather to a state of permanent winter, or strengthen winter conditions already present. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest themselves. The GM determines the current natural weather conditions You then choose what wintry conditions you want to manifest; these can include supernatural and extreme conditions such as Arctic Cold Temperatures (found in the Tundra Update), hurricane winds and blanket snowfall. Lakes, rivers, and even seas can be frozen over during a *fimbulwinter*, and crop failures and famine are likely.

You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind, though it is always cold and wintry. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use an action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). The snowglobe focus can be smashed by using an action to make a DC 20 Strength check. If successful, the spell ends, and the weather gradually returns to normal over the next 10 minutes.

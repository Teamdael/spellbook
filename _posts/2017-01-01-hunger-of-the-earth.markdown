**4th-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a gemstone worth at least 100gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

The earth opens up beneath a creature you can see within range, and swallows them up. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be restrained for the duration. Furthermore, if the target fails the save, it sinks two feet into the ground. Climbing out requires ten feet of movement for every two feet the target has been dragged down.

While the target remains in the same space (whether it is restrained by the spell or not), it sinks at a rate of two feet per round. This sinking happens at the start of the caster's turn, and cannot be resisted in any way. If a target that needs to breathe has all of its airways dragged underground, it begins to suffocate, unless provided with some kind of magical or mechanical breathing aid.

If a target is restrained by this spell, the target or another creature can attempt to free the target by using an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing the target on a success. The target has disadvantage on this Strength check.

Creatures with a flying speed are immune to this spell.

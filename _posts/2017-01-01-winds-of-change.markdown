**7th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a fan)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Howling winds swoop in, orbiting a point that you designate within range and rearranging creatures caught within a 30-foot radius. Each creature within the spell’s area is teleported to an unoccupied position you choose within the area. An unwilling creature can make a Charisma saving throw to avoid this effect.

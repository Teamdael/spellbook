**3rd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 600 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a small replica cannon)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You summon a cannonball, mid-flight and at full velocity, which explodes on impact. Make a spell attack roll against a target you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage, and each creature within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes half as much damage as the target.

**Evocation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You make a flick of the wrist and a small bolt of energy races towards a target you can see within range. The target takes 1d4 + 1 force damage. Effects that stop Magic Missile stop this spell as well.

The spell creates more than one bolt when you reach higher levels: two bolts at 5th level, three bolts at 11th level, and four bolts at 17th level. Your can direct the bolts at the same target or at different ones.

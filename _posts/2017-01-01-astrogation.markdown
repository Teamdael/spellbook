**7th-level divination**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (rare spices and incense worth at least 500gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

By burning rare spices and incense, you can briefly determine your course through the universe. If you perform a void jump while this spell is in effect, you roll twice on the Jump Navigation table (***Ships Chapter in Dark Matter*** by Middle Finger of Vecna), taking the result you choose, and add 50 to the roll. If your result is greater than 100, you treat the roll as a 100.

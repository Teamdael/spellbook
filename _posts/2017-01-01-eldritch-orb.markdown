**Evocation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You fling a ball of eldritch energy at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage, and each other creature within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes half as much damage. This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

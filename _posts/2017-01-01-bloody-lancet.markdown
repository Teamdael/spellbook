**Necromancy cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 10 feet

**Components**: V, M (a weapon)

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the weapon's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects and you drain life energy from them, gaining 1d4 temporary hit points.
This spell deals additional damage when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to the target, and you gain 2d4 temporary hit points. The damage roll increases by a further 1d6 and the hit points by 1d4 at 11th level and 17th level

**2nd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

The touch of your acid-soaked hand can corrode metal and burn flesh. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage, and any nonmagical armor it is wearing takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. On a miss, any shield it is wielding takes a similar -1 penalty. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

**4th-level chronomancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (an hourglass and a glass eye worth at least 100 gp)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cast your senses back in time to perceive your current location as it was at some point in the past, including any events that were happening at that time. You must specify the exact time you wish to see, which cannot be more than 100 years ago. When viewing the past, it appears dreamlike and shadowy, but you are able to discern detail and hear conversation as normal, and any special senses you possess (such as darkvision) also work as normal.

While perceiving the past, you can look in any direction, but you cannot move or speak and are unable to sense your present surroundings.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you may share this spell with one other creature that you touch. An unwilling target may make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid being affected. In addition, when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can choose to perceive a time up to 1,000 years ago.

**2nd-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: S

**Duration**: Varies (see below)

You draw out a portion of your own blood as you kiss another humanoid. As you cast the spell, you must expend a number of hit points. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you for 1 hour for every 3 hit points spent on the casting of the spell or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature falls hopelessly in love with you. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

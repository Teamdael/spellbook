**1st-level divination**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you know if there is any creature that has been invested with legal authority or that has been outlawed by such an authority within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

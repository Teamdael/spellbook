**1st-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of a scythe blade)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a scythe out of necrotic energy in your free hands. The scythe is a large weapon, requires both hands to wield, and lasts for the duration. If you let go of the scythe, it disappears, but you can conjure it again as a bonus action.

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the scythe. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, you regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.

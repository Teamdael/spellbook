**4th-level conjuration (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a fresh drop of your own blood)

**Duration**: 1 hour

You summon forth a 10-foot-tall pillar 5 feet across covered in runic inscriptions from the depths of the Accursed Archive, a forbidden library. Any creature within 5 ft. of it can attempt to read from the obelisk as an action. The reader must make a Wisdom saving throw. If they succeed, they gain advantage on Wisdom ability checks and saving throws for one hour. If they fail, they are struck blind for one minute. A creature can only attempt to read from this pillar once per time it is summoned.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration of the blindness increases to 10 minutes and the duration of advantage increases to 2 hours.

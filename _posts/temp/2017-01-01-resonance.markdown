**3rd-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You sing to the inherent order within the ground around you. While you maintain concentration on this spell, you can use your action to disrupt that order. Choose a 10-foot cube within range. Creatures and objects within that square must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they sink into the ground as it softens and rehardens, becoming restrained for as long as you maintain concentration. Each round, the target can make a Strength saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Until the spell ends you can repeat this process, choosing a different 10-foot cube.

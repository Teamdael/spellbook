**4th-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose up to 4 creatures within range. Each creature has their shadow forcibly ripped from their body, conjuring a Shadow (see *Monster Manual* pg. 269) in an unoccupied space next to them. As long as the shadow is separate from their body, they do not cast a shadow. A shadow created through this spell reforms with its host when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends, and it disappears if it's host dies. If its host dies, a new shadow does not rise from the corpse.

The shadows seek only to attack the creature they were separated from, and disappear when that creature is killed. Roll initiative for the shadows as a group, which has its own turns. They spend their turns attacking their host, without any thought for strategy or tactics. The DM has the creatureâ€™s statistics.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using certain higher level spell slots, you can target more creatures: 8 with a 6th-level slot and 12 with an 8th-level slot.

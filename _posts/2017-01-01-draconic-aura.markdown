**3rd-level illusion**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (15-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a bit of sponge)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You assume a formidable aura of draconic presence. Each creature you choose within 15 feet of you, as well as any creature you choose that enters the area or begins its turn there for the first time, must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for the duration. While frightened by this spell, a creature treats the area of the spell as difficult terrain and has disadvantage on attack rolls while it is within that area.
If a creature ends its turn outside the area, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature, even if it returns within the spellâ€™s area. If the creature fails this save three times, it is frightened for the duration and can no longer make saving throws against it.

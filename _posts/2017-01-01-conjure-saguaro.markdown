**1st-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a saguaro fruit)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon an immense saguaro cactus that springs outof the ground in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The cactus now occupies a 10-foot cube, blocking movement through this area and conferring 3/4 cover against ranged attacks made through it.
The saguaro is an object with 22 (4d10) hit points and an AC of 14. When the spell ends, the saguaro wilts away, leaving no trace of its existence

**2nd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you taking an action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

As a reaction when a creature you can see within range takes the Attack, Dash, Dodge, or Disengage action, you can attempt to distort its thinking. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature instead takes your choice of those actions.

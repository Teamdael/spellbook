**5th-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You seal shut the mouths, blowholes or other airways of a creature you can see within range. While the creature remains within range for the duration, that creature cannot breathe and must hold its breath or begin suffocating. If a creature takes damage while holding its breath it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher) or be forced to release its held breath and immediately begin suffocating.

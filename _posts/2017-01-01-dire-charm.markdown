**4th-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a nymph's eyelash, worth at least 100gp. If you are a nymph, you may use one of your own)

**Duration**: 10 days

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and has disadvantage unless you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends. If you or your companions do anything harmful to it, it can reattempt the saving throw. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration becomes permanent (until dispelled).

**1st-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 minute

You evoke a blade of destructive energy in your hand. This blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade it disappears, but you can evoke it again as a bonus action. The damage type of the spell is acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, chosen when you cast the spell. You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the blade. The target takes 2d6 damage on a hit. The blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell at 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every level of spell slot above 1st.

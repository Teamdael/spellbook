**1st-level chronomancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a small silver mirror)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You briefly rewind the thoughts a creature of your choice that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. A creature that took no actions on its previous turn automatically succeeds this saving throw. On a failed save, the target on its next turn must repeat the actions it performed in its previous turn. It can use its reaction as normal; it is not forced to repeat a reaction it made previously. If the situation has changed in such a way that the subject can’t take the same actions again, the subject stands still and takes no actions or bonus actions for 1 round.

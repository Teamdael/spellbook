**7th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (an almost spherical stone)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

At a point you choose within range, you conjure into existence a Large 8-foot diameter boulder which rolls in pursuit of one creature that you can see of your choice. The boulder has 18 AC, 75 HP, and resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. If the boulder is reduced to 0 hit points, it vanishes.

At the beginning of each of your turns, the boulder moves 60 feet in the direction of its target. If the boulder enters a creature's space, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage and, if it is Large size or smaller, is knocked prone. The boulder also crushes nonmagical objects smaller than itself in its path. If the boulder reaches its target, it rolls over it and continues on, completing its 60-foot movement. The boulder continues to pursue its target for the duration, rolling over it more than once, if possible.

After the spell ends, the boulder continues to pursue its target for up to 24 hours. Once the boulder strikes its target after the spell ends, it immediately vanishes.

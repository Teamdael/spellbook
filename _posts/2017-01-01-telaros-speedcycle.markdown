**4th-level conjuration [futuristic]**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 hour

A Large vehicle with two wheels and holographic circuits appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. The cycle has AC 10 and 10 hit points. It roars to life whenever its controls are grasped. For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the cycle, and one creature can ride as a passenger. The cycle has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour.
Wherever the cycle moves, it leaves behind a brightly-chromatic, translucent wall of force behind it. The wall is 10 feet high and nothing can physically pass through it. It is immune to all damage, but a 20-foot long portion of it can be destroyed by a dispel magic or disintegrate spell. Portions of the wall that the rider creates by moving the cycle vanish at the end of the rider's next turn.
The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it, if the cycle is reduced to 0 hit points or more points, or if the cycle collides with its walls or another substantial obstacle. The walls of force vanish when the spell ends. If the spell ends as a result of taking damage or a collision, the rider and passenger both fall prone.

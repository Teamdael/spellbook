**3rd-level evocation [renaissance]**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 600 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 8 hours

A ship of your choice with at least 1 sail that you can see within range is either hastened or slowed (your choice) by amagical wind that fills its sails. If you choose to hasten the ship, it  moves at one and one-half times its maximum speed for the duration, regardless of wind direction. If you choose to slow the ship, its helmsman must make a sailing check against your spell save DC. On a failed check, the ship moves at half speed for the duration, or until it is more than 200 feet from you. The helmsman may repeat this check at the beginning of each of its turns. On a successful check, the ship can move normally for that round.

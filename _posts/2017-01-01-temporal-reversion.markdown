**5th-level chronomancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

The wounds of a creature you touch travel back in time to before they were inflicted. The creature regains hit points equal to 7d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This healing works as normal on undead and constructs.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 5th.

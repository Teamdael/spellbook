**2nd-level transmutation (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (owl feathers)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 10-foot radius dome of magical darkness that lasts for the duration. A creature with darkvision cannot see through the walls of the dome, and nonmagical light canâ€™t illuminate it. The dome is filled with dim light, and the inside of the dome shows an accurate representation of the night sky, including the current location of the stars and moon.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

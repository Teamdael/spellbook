**5th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (40-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You open an instantaneous portal to the heart of R'lyeh, allowing the Dead Mists to wreak havoc. Each creature within a 40-foot radius area around you (including yourself) must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 6d8 necrotic and 6d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed, or half as much on a successful one.

When you cast this spell, you can choose to take 10 points of necrotic damage, which ignores both damage resistance and damage immunity. If you do so, you can choose a number of creatures in the area equal to your spellcasting modifier. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw against this spell.

**2nd-level conjuration (ritual) [renaissance]**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a bit of sponge)

**Duration**: 1 hour

One firearm you are holding becomes enchanted to reload itself automatically. When the weaponâ€™s ammunition is depleted, new ammunition teleports from your person into the weapon, reloading it. If the weapon has the Loading property, you can ignore this for the duration. If the weapon takes an action or longer to reload (such as with the Reload (2 actions) property), it reloads itself at the end of your turn.

If you are not carrying sufficient ammunition for the weapon to reload, or if you stop holding it, the spell ends.

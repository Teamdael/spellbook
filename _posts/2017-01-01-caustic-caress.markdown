**Evocation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

With a harsh, almost unintelligible word your hand becomes coated in a volatile substance that doesn't harm you or your equipment when manifested. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 acid damage. At the beginning of you next turn the target takes an additional 1d6 acid damage.

Both the initial and secondary damage are increased by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6/2d6), 11th level (3d6/3d6), and 17th level (4d6/4d6).

**5th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range, which must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target is also on fire for the spellâ€™s duration. A creature that is on fire repeats this saving throw at the end of each of its turns. It takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the flames go out on a successful one. The flames cannot be extinguished by nonmagical means.

If a creature within 90 feet of you is on fire due to this spell, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause the flames to leap to up to two other creatures within 30 feet of it. Each of these creatures must make a Constitution saving throw or also catch on fire. A creature that successfully saves against this spell can't be caught on fire again by the same instance of it again.

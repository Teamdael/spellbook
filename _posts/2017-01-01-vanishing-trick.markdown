**2nd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you are targeted by an attack

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of pixie dust)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You vanish in a puff of glitter just as your opponent makes their attack. When you cast this spell, you immediately teleport into an unoccupied space within 5 feet. This may cause the triggering attack to miss, either because you are no longer in range, or because it puts you behind cover that raises your AC.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the teleport distance increases by 5 feet for every spell level above 2nd.

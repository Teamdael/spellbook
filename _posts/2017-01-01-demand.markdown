**6th-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Unlimited

**Components**: V, S, M (a snake's tongue and a piece of copper wire)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 8 hours

You send a short message of twenty-five words or fewer to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message. You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesnâ€™t arrive.
You can use this message to suggest a reasonable sounding course of activity to the target, in which case the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to follow your instructions for the duration, as per the suggestion spell.

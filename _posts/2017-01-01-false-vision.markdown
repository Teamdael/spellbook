**4th-level illusion**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch each of diamond, ruby, emerald and sapphire dust, worth a total of 100 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: 8 hours

For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination magic. The target can be a willing creature, a place, or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension.  If the target is targeted by any divination magic or perceived through a scrying spellâ€™s sensors, you are able to present the diviner with false information of your choice, as long as you are conscious at the time of the divination attempt. The target could appear to be in different circumstances, in one or more false locations, or completely undetectable as you desire.

**1st-level enchantment (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a quartz crystal)

**Duration**: 1 hour

You touch a spaceship, granting it a limited ability to operate without active control by its crew. For the duration, the ship can make ability checks and saving throws that would be made by its pilot, engineer, or gunner, even if there is no one in those roles. The ship’s ability scores are treated as being 10 for each ability, and it has no proficiencies.
Additionally, when you cast this spell, you can choose a speed and direction within the ship’s cone of movement for the ship to travel when there is no creature in the pilot role. The ship moves automatically at the beginning of the initiative order. This automatic movement ends whenever a creature enters the pilot role. A ship cannot be commandeered while it is under the influence of this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases to 8 hours.

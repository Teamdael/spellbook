**Evocation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You conjure a chain and hook made of magical force, which you propel at a creature, object, or unoccupied space you can see within range. When you target a space, your grapnel pulls you to that spot in a straight line. You provoke opportunity attacks for this movement as normal.

When you target a creature or object that isnâ€™t being worn or carried, you pull the target up to 10 feet towards you. A creature can make a Strength saving throw to resist this movement. If the target is Huge or larger, you are pulled to the target instead.

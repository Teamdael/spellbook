**2nd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (meltwater from a glacier)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

This spell creates a snowy servant from snow within 60 feet. Your spell imbues the target with a semblance of life for the duration, raising it as two separate snowmen.
On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against  hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you animate two additional snowmen for each slot level above 2nd.

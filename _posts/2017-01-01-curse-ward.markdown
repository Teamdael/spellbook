**2nd-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 hour

You reach out your hand and touch a willing target within your reach, raising a smoke-like barrier around it. For the duration, the target has resistance to necrotic damage and can't be cursed, possessed, or targeted by a hex. Also, its maximum hit points can't be lowered. If the target is already affected by one of these effects, the effect is suspended until the spell ends

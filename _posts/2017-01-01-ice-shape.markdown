**4th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a shard of ice)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You touch an ice object of Medium size or smaller or a section of ice no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. For example, you could shape a large block of ice into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall of ice, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape an ice door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isnâ€™t possible.

**6th-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You speak a word of disgusting power that can overwhelm the body of one creature you can see within range, leaving it sickened. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is poisoned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. The sickened target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this effect ends.

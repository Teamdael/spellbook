**6th-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

With a piercing glare and sinister gesture, you send a ribbon of dark magic into a targetâ€™s body. A creature you can see within range is cursed for the duration and suffers from one of the following effects of your choice while cursed:
* ***Dull Reflexes.*** The target has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws.
* ***Feeble Fortitude.*** The target has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws and can't regain hit points.
* ***Weak Will.*** The target has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws as well as spell attack rolls.

A *remove curse* spell ends this curse early

**7th-level enchantment (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a body part from the intended target, such as a fingernail, a lock of hair, or a drop of blood)

**Duration**: Until dispelled

You bind one creature or object to a location, cursing it so that it may never leave. Choose a target and a location within range, both of which you must be able to see. If the target is a creature, it must make a Charisma saving throw (a willing creature may choose to fail this save), or be cursed to be permanently bound to the chosen location. While cursed, the target can act and move around freely, as long as it remains within 20 feet of the point it is bound to. If the target begins its turn outside of this area, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be dragged 60 feet towards the point it was bound to.
In addition, if the creature attempts to teleport or use any other means of extraplanar travel, it must make another Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the travel attempt fails and any resources used are wasted. On a success, the curse is suppressed until the creature returns to the plane on which it was bound, at which point the dragging effect resumes.

A *remove curse* spell ends this curse.

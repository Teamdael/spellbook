**1st-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (incense and a black candle)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Lighting a candle, you speak dark curses in a lost tongue, directed at one creature you can see within range. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed for the duration. While cursed, whenever that creature takes the Attack or Cast a Spell action, it takes psychic damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier. The creature can repeat their saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a success.
A *remove curse* spell ends this curse early.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, you deal an additional 1d8 psychic damage for each slot level above 1st.

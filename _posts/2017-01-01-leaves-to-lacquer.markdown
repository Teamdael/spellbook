**2nd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 20 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (an empty cocoon)

**Duration**: 24 hours, or until temporary hit points are exhausted

This spell gathers nearby live foliage within its range to encase one object that you touch with a volume of no more than 1 cubic foot. The plant material transforms into a tough, resilient, waterproof, and airtight coating that protects the object. The object is granted 5 temporary hit points, a fixed AC of 16 unless it would normally higher, and gains resistance to acid, cold, lightning, and thunder damage. A container that opens and closes can be sealed in such a way to protect the contents inside, but while the lacquer remains, it cannot be opened by any means.

This spell can also be used to protect weapons and armor from damage and corrosion but does not provide any benefit to the creature using them.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, each spell level above 2nd increases the total volume affected by 1 cubic foot, grants 5 additional temporary HP, and grants 1 additional point of AC.

**3rd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Components**: V, S, M (a wisp of smoke)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything itâ€™s wearing and carrying, into an animated shadow for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points.

While in this form, the target's only method of movement is a walking and climbing speed of 30 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can't fall and remains stuck to the ground even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated. While in the shadowy form, the target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can't attack or cast spells.

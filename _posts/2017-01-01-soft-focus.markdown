**Illusion cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 minute

When you cast this spell, everything you see becomes slightly hazy and out-of-focus, which makes the world seem comforting and safe. You have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws for the duration. This spell ends early if you take damage.

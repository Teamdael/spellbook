**7th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a creature and attempt to freeze it in place. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 8d8 cold damage and is restrained. At the end of each of its turns, the creature makes a Constitution saving throw. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to ice and is petrified for the duration, and if it succeeds three times, the spell ends immediately. The successes and failures donâ€™t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. Additionally, any creature reduced to zero hit points by damage from this spell is immediately frozen (and stable) as if it had failed three saves against the spell.

If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state. While petrified, it is immune to cold damage and vulnerable to fire damage.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to ice until the effect is removed.

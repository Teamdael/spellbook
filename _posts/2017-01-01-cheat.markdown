**Divination cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: S, M (a weighted die)

**Duration**: 1 round

You subtly twist your fingers and fate seems to follow suit. For the duration, you can reroll any ability check you make to play nonmagical games of skill. Therefore, this ability could influence a game of poker, but not the result of a *Deck of Many Things*.

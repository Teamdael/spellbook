**9th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (an amber statuette of a treant worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Choose a single Huge or larger oak tree within range that is alive and healthy. The target becomes a *treant* (the DM has game statistics for it).

The treant is charmed by you for 30 days, or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it, or until you cast this spell again. When the charmed condition ends, the treant chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.

**3rd-level necromancy (hemomancy)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 10 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (droplets of blood)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You animate droplets of your own blood to act under your command. For every three hit points expended in the casting of this spell, you create a droplet of animated blood.

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command the droplets to move as long as they are within 120 feet of you. The droplets have a speed of 30 feet, and a climbing speed
of 15 feet.

As an action on your turn, you can choose to see and hear from the location of one of the blood droplets until the end of your turn, becoming blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

Additionally, you may instead use your action to cause one of the droplets to explode in a burst of necromantic energy, destroying the droplet and damaging surrounding creatures. Each creature
within 5 feet of the droplet must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 4d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

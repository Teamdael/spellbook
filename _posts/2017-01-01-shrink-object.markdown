**3rd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 day

You touch an object that is not being worn or carried and cause it to grow smaller for the duration. The target's size is divided by 4 in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-sixteenth of its previous weight. This reduction decreases its size by two categories?from Medium to Tiny, for example?unless it would still be Gargantuan after shrinking. If the target is a standard weapon, it is transformed into the nearest equivalent on the Tiny Weapons table. If no equivalent exists, the weapon is unusable for the duration.
This spell can affect an assembly or collection of objects, as long as they form a single cohesive entity, such as a ship or building. Contents of the collection or assembly that are not creatures are also shrunk. Any creatures that are inside an object when it is shrunk are magically shunted to the nearest available space outside the object if they would no longer fit inside it.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4rd level or higher, the object's dimensions are halved again, its weight is divided by 8 again, and its size is decreased by one additional category for each slot level above 3rd, to a minimum of 1/16th the original object's dimensions at 5th level.

**1st-level necromancy (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (an ounce or more of blood)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

At your touch, wet blood on a surface shifts and reforms into a pattern of crimson blotches. This blood print is unique to the particular creature to whom the blood belongs, but you can determine the creatureâ€™s kind (such as human, gnoll, deer, or fire giant) by examining the general shape. A print can be preserved by pressing a sheet of paper against the it. If this spell is cast twice, it is possible to match samples of blood originating from the same creature by comparing the prints.

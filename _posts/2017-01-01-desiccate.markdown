**3rd-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your hands radiate crimson energy. Make a melee spell attack against a target within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and suffers a level of exhaustion, as you siphon the water from its body. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action. Each creature you target with this spell can only suffer one level exhaustion as a direct result of this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 damage for every slot level above 3rd.

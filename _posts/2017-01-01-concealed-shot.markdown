**Illusion cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: S, M (a firearm)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make an attack with a firearm, otherwise the spell fails. The spell then masks any audible or visible output from the weapon, making it impossible to see or hear where the shot came from. This spell only conceals the first shot you make; any additional shots are not concealed.

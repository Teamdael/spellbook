**Chronomancy cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V

**Duration**: 1 round

You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. When you cast this spell, your current turn ends and no time passes for other creatures, while you take 1 free turn, during which you can use actions and a bonus action as normal. However, you cannot move from the location where this spell was cast, nor can you affect any object other than those worn or carried by you (as everything else is frozen in time), make any kind of attack, or cast any spells. If you let go of an item you were carrying, it also becomes frozen in time. If you consume a potion during the free turn, it has no effect (though it is consumed). Listed below are a few examples of what you could do on your free turn:
* Make an Intelligence check to remember information about something.
* Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.
* Take the Hide action.
* Deploy a bag of caltrops.
* Draw or stow weapons and shields.

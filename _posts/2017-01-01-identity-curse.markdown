**9th-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Until dispelled

You extend a finger to a creature's temple, who then forgets its own name. Choose one creature you can touch to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target falls unconscious for 1 hour and is cursed to forget its identity. When the target awakes, it loses all its personal memories, though the target retains all of its general knowledge, proficiencies, and other statistics. The target will not realize it has any class features or special abilities, and so does not willingly make use of them. If left to its own devices, the target will quickly adopt a new name and begin to build a new identity.

A remove curse spell ends this curse. When this curse ends, the target regains all its past memories.

**Transmutation cantrip [futuristic]**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 minute

You conjure into existence a spectral microphone, which can hover in front of you or be held in one hand. Speaking through the microphone amplifies your voice to a booming level and allows you to distort your voice. This distortion can change your voice's pitch, cause an echo, make it sound metallic, add a layer of static noise, or any other simple audio effect. It cannot be used to completely duplicate another person's voice. You can change the mic's volume and change the nature of the distortion on your turn (no action required.) Your voice also projects through radio waves allowing you to be heard on comm sets and communication systems within 10 miles.

You can use your action to shout into the mic. When you do so, each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 thunder damage.

The spellâ€™s damage increases when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

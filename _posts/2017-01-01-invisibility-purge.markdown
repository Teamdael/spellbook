**4th-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (120-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (powdered silver worth at least 100 gp)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You purge magical invisibility effects within 120 feet of you. Any creature, object, location or effect within 120 feet of you that is hidden by magical invisibility is revealed and the effect dispelled.

This spell applies to innate abilities such as an imp’s Invisibility or a faerie dragon’s Superior Invisibility (as long as they are magical in nature) but it does not affect creatures on other planes (such as the Ethereal Plane), nor creatures that are naturally invisible. Items that grant magical invisibility (such as a ring of invisibility) have their effects suppressed for 1 minute.

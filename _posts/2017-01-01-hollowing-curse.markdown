**1st-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Tendrils of black mist extend from your fingertips, latching onto a creature and draining its vitality. Choose a creature you can see within range to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d12 necrotic damage and is cursed for up to one minute. While the target is cursed, you can use your action to deal 1d12 necrotic damage to it automatically. The curse ends early if you use your action to do anything else, or if the target is ever outside the spellâ€™s range or if it has total cover from you. A remove curse spell also ends this curse.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st..

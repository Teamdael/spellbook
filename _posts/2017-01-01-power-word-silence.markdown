**7th-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it silenced. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is unable to speak or perform the verbal components of spells. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. After 1 minute, the silenced target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this effect ends.

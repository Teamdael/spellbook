**3rd-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (60-foot radius)

**Components**: V

**Duration**: 1 minute

You utter a vile curse, and will away the healing magic of nature and the gods alike. Each time a creature within a 60-foot radius of you would recover hit points, it must make a Charisma saving
throw. If it fails, it does not recover hit points and instead takes 1d6 psychic damage. You can end this spell as an action.

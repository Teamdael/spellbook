**9th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (clay and water)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You choose an area of stone or lava that you can see that fits within a 40-foot cube and that is within range, and choose one of the following effects.
Stone to Lava. Nonmagical stone of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of thick and flowing lava that remains for the spell's duration and sets fire to any flammable material it comes into contact with. If you cast the spell on an area of ground, any creatures in that area begin to sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the lava costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature 54

on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make this save the first time it enters the area on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the lava, takes 10d10 fire damage, and is restrained, though it can use an action to end the restrained condition on itself by pulling itself free of the lava. On a successful save, or when a creature uses its action to pull itself out of the lava, the creature takes 5d10 fire damage. If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the lava falls. Any creature under lava when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and 10d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Lava to Stone. Nonmagical lava or magma in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft, cool stone for the spell's duration. Any creature in the lava when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the stone. The restrained creature can use an action to try to break free by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing 25 damage to the stone around it. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface to an unoccupied space.

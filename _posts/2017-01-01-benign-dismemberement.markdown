**3rd-level necromancy (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 hour

For the duration, a willing target's body parts (fingers, legs, tail, and even its head) can be harmlessly severed from its body. It takes no damage from such dismemberment, as long as the cut removing the body part is swift and leaves a clean cut. The target's head remains alive and conscious, and parts connected to it also remain alive. All severed body parts become inanimate, but do not begin decomposition for the spell's duration. Any of the target's severed body parts that are removed during this spell's duration can be held back to the stump, which instantly causes the part to knit to the stump, restoring the body part. 
At the end of the duration, severed body parts become permanent, and the target dies if vital organs have not been reattached to its head.

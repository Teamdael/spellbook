**5th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a cup of human blood)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a horrible creature from beyond the stars, to do your bidding. An elemental creature of your choice (a despair elemental, fear elemental, madness elemental, pain elemental, or rage elemental (see ***Lovecraft Handbook*** by Middle Finger of Vecna for statistics)) emerges from a portal that opens within range.
The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. If your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.

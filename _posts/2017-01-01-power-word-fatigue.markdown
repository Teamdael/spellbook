**5th-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Instantaneous

***NOTE:*** Pretty sure I can't allow this, repeated castings of this spell seem like an easy way to cheese an encounter, especially as it bypasses legendary resistance.

You speak a word of power that drains the body of one creature you can see within range, leaving it tired and fatigued. The target gains one level of exhaustion.

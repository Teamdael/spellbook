**3rd-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a drop of water or a piece of ice)

**Duration**: 8 hours

You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor, and a chain shirt, made a glimmering ice, appears on their body. The target’s base AC becomes 14 + its Dexterity modifier. Additionally, whenever a creature hits the target of this spell with a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 cold damage. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

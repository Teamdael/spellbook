**9th-level conjuration [futuristic]**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 500 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (an emerald ring worth 30 gp)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 3 rounds

You focus an aurora of light into an immense hardlight construct: an orbital cannon positioned 1 mile above your head. The cannon fires a blinding beam of energy, which lands in a 15-foot radius, 1-mile high cylinder centered on a point within range. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is scorched by the beam’s energy, and it must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 20d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The spell ignites nonmagical flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

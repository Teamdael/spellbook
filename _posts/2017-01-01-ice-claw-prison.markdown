**3rd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a crystal claw)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You choose an unoccupied 10-foot square area that you can see within range. A Large clawed hand made from razor-sharp ice appears there and lasts for the spell’s duration. It acts at your command, though it cannot move from its initial location.

The hand is an object that has AC 18 and hit points equal to half your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. The claw doesn’t fill its space. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can command the claw to perform one of the following tasks:
* ***Slash.*** The claw lashes out at a target within 10 feet of itself. Make a melee spell attack using your spell attack bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 slashing or cold damage (your choice).
* ***Imprison.*** The claw grabs a large or smaller target within 10 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be dragged into the claw's space and restrained for the duration. To escape, the restrained target can make a Strength check against your spell save DC on the end of each of its turns. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand, but on a failure it takes 1d6 cold damage. While a creature is restrained by the hand, the hand can’t imprison or slash another creature. The claw can slash a creature it has restrained.
* ***Release.*** The claw releases an imprisoned target, which is no longer restrained.

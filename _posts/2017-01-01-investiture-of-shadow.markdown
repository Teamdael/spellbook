**6th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, shadows swirl around you, and you gain the following benefits:

* At the start of each of your turns, you turn invisible. If you attack or cast a spell, this invisibility ends.
* You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.
* You can use your action to create a 15-foot radius sphere of magical darkness centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you, as per the darkness spell. This darkness lasts for the duration, or until you activate this ability again.

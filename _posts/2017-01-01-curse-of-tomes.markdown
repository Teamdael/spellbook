**1st-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 24 hours

You speak the backward words of a dead language, scrambling the letters in a target's mind. Choose one creature within range to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is cursed for the duration. A cursed target can't read or write any language for the duration, prepare spells from a spellbook, perform rituals, or cast any spells that involve writing runes or sigils. At the end of each hour, the target can repeat this save, ending the effects early on a success.
A *remove curse* spell ends this curse early

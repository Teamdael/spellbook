**2nd-level abjuration (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a drop of blessed oil or holy water)

**Duration**: 8 hours

You trace a holy symbol on your chest, and an invisible barrier protects you until the spell ends. Your base AC becomes 12 + your Dexterity modifier. If you are attacked by a fiend or undead, your AC becomes 15 + your spellcasting ability modifier against that attack.

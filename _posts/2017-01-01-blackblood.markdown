**1st-level transmutation (hemomancy)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 minute

You transform a portion of your blood into a poisonous substance. As you cast this spell, you must expend a number of hit points. You gain a number of temporary equal to the amount expended. For as long as these temporary hit points last, whenever a creature hits you with an attack while within 5 feet of you they become poisoned for 1 minute. A creature poisoned in this way makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success or taking 1d6 poison damage on a failure.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the poison damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

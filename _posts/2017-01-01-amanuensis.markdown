**Transmutation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a quill or pen, which is animated by the spell)

**Duration**: 10 minutes

You touch a quill or pen and cause it to copy writing from one source (such as a book) into a blank book, paper, or parchment. This spell copies up to 2,500 words, creating a perfect duplicate of the original. The spell copies only nonmagical text, not illustrations or magical writings (such as the text of a spellbook or a spell scroll). If the source contains normal and magical writing (such as a letter with explosive runes), only the normal text is copied, leaving blank space in the copied text where the magical writing would be expected. Likewise, if the source contains both text and illustrations, only the text is copied. The spell does not translate the copied writing. If you do not understand the original, you have no additional ability to understand the copy.

The spell triggers (but does not copy) writing-based magic traps in the material being copied. Blank paper, parchment, or a book must be provided for the spell to write upon. If more pages in the source exist than blank pages are available, the spell copies the original until it runs out of blank pages. At any time during the spell's duration you can redirect the magic to copy from another source, copy onto a different set of blanks, or resume a duplication that was interrupted by a shortfall of blank pages

**Transmutation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 actionn

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a deck of playing cards)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

With a flash of your hands, you fling a number of playing cards charged with energy at your opponents. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage. Alternatively, you can target a space within range instead of a creature; each creature within 5 feet of that space must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 force damage on a failed save.
You can throw 1 additional card on your turn at 5th level (2 cards), at 11th level (3 cards), and at 17th level (4 cards).

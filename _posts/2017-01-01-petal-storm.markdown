**2nd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a handful of flower petals)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Choose an unoccupied 5-foot cube of air that you can see within range. An elemental force of swirling winds appears in the cube and lasts for the spellâ€™s duration.

Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the petal storm must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 slashing damage and has disadvantage on any attack rolls it makes before the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no additional penalty.

As a bonus action, you can move the storm up to 30 feet in any direction. If it moves over leaf litter, flowers, bushes, or trees, it sucks up extra material and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of leaves and petals around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The cloud heavily obscures its area.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

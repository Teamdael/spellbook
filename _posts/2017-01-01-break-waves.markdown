**1st-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, when you would take bludgeoning damage from water or be pushed against your will

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

This spell diverts incoming energy when you are struck by a volume of water, either naturally or magically motivated, or by some other force that can push you against your will. You are not moved or knocked prone by the triggering effect. If the effect was a volume of water or some other fluid that would deal damage to you, you have immunity to bludgeoning damage from the force of its impact until the end of your next turn.

**2nd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 500 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 75-foot-radius area of water that you specify within range begins to roil and pitch as if being affected by a strong gale. Ships in the area move at half speed as they are buffeted about by waves. Each swimming creature you choose in the area must make a Strength (Athletics) check opposed by your spell save DC when it attempts to swim. On a failed check, the creature does not move, and is instead tossed by the waves within its space.

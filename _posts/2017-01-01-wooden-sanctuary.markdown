**2nd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You step into a wooden object or tree large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the wood for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the wood at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.
While merged with the wood, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the wood. You can use your movement to leave the wood where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can't move.
Minor physical damage to the wood doesn't harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage to you; the same happens if your concentration is broken while merged with the wood. The wood's complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 25 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.

**9th-level chronomancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a pair of hourglasses, worth at least 100gp each)

**Duration**: 1 hour

You create a transparent magical zone where time flows differently in a 50-foot cube centered on a point of your choice within range. No material, spell or effect can pass into or out of the zone unless it travels through another plane of existence to do so (such as by using misty step, etherealness, or dimension door.) Choose one of the following effects for the zone.
Dilated Time. Time passes slower inside the zone, so that any creatures inside it experience 10 minutes for every hour that passes outside.
Hyperbolic Time. Time passes faster inside the zone, so that any creatures inside it experience 24 hours for every hour that passes outside.

**5th-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

You cause a creature of your choice to be overtaken by exhaustion. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains a level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the creature suffers no effect and the spell ends. At the start of each of their turns, the creature must repeat the saving throw. It gains a level of exhaustion on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one.

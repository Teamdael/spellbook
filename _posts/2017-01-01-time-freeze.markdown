**8th-level chronomancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (an iron hourglass)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Choose a creature that you can see within range. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is paralyzed and frozen in time, unaware of its surroundings. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this paralysis effect ends.

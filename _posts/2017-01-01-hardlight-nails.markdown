**2nd-level conjuration [futuristic]**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (an emerald ring worth at least 30 gp)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Thousands of bright, miniscule spikes of compressed light form in a 10-foot square on a surface you choose within range. This area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves within the area, it takes 2d6 force damage for every 5 feet it travels.

As a reaction when a creature moves in front of the area of spikes, you can cause them to explode outward, peppering the target with spikes and ending the spell. Each
creature within 30 feet of the spikes must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 force damage, or half as much on a successful save.

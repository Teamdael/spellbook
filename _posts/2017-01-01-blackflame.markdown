**1st-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You choose a flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. The flame momentarily changes color into a deep black, and then lashes out at surrounding creatures. Each creature within a 5-foot radius of the flame must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 1d6 necrotic damage and 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

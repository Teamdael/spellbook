**Transmutation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (at least 1 gold piece, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

With a flourish, you toss a number of gold pieces at a target within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 magical bludgeoning damage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12), but the number of gold pieces required to cast the spell increases as well: 2gp at 5th level, 3gp at 11th level, and 4gp at 17th level. When you can cast this spell, you can choose to cast it as if you were of a lower level, dealing less damage and using less gp.

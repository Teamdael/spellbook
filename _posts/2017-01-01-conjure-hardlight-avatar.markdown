**8th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (an emerald ring worth 30gp)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 15 hours

You conjure into being all the shimmering gears, pistons, plates, and motors of a sophisticated hardlight construct. Your choice of a hardlight etherolus or a hardlight juggernautus (for statistics see ***Dark Matter*** by Middle Finger of Vecna) appears in an unoccupied space within range. The construct disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
Roll initiative for the construct, which has its own turns. As a bonus action, you can mentally command the construct if it is within 500 feet of you. You decide what action the construct will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the construct only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the construct continues to follow it until its task is complete.
No magic can restore the construct's hit points, as hardlight always evaporates away with time.

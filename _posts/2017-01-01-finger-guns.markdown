**Evocation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: 40 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 minute

You extend your index finger and thumb, a dangerous gesture mimicking a gun. For the duration, you can use your action to make a spell attack roll against one creature you can see within 40 feet, dealing 1d8 force damage on a hit.

Your finger gun does not require ammunition, but is still considered to be a firearm for spells and effects such as bursting shot and protection from ballistics.

The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

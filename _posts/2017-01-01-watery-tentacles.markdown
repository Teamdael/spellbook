**4th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (an octopus tentacle)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

When you cast this spell, three tentacles made of water appear around your body for the duration. As part of the action used to cast the spell, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can command one of these tentacles to grapple a Large or smaller creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be grappled and restrained by the tentacle. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw.
You can grapple as many creatures as you have tentacles. You can use an action or bonus action on your turn to release a grappled creature, or to drag it up to 20 feet in a direction you choose. A watery tentacle can lift a creature up to 10 feet into the air as part of this move, but the creature must begin and end its move on solid ground. If it does not, the grapple automatically ends.
You can also use the tentacles to manipulate nonliving objects as an action or a bonus action. Each tentacle can lift up to 100 lb., and you can command multiple tentacles to work together to lift the same object as part of the same action or bonus action. Watery tentacles are not capable of detailed control?for example, they cannot open a chest or uncork a bottle. Burning objects are extinguished when the tentacle grabs them.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using spell slot of 5th level or higher, you gain an additional tentacle for every slot level above 4th.

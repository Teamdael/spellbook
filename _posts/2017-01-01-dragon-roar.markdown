**1st-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (10-foot radius)

**Components**: V

**Duration**: 1 round

You bellow forth a great noise like a dragon’s roar, audible out to 500 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half that damage and isn’t frightened.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st

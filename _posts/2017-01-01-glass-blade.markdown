**2nd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a handful of sand)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You hold out your palm, and cause sand to whirl through the air and transmute roughly into the shape of a scimitar, whose blade is razor-sharp glass, and which lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade it reforms into sand, but you can transmute it back again as a bonus action. You can use your action to make a melee weapon attack with the blade, as if it had the properties of a scimitar. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 slashing damage. This damage is magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical slashing damage. The magic of this spell prevents this scimitar from being broken by nonmagical means.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 damage for every two slot levels above 2nd.

**4th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a skeletal hand)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A wall of writhing bones and skeletons springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 4 inches thick and is composed of three 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice).

Any creature that starts its turn next to a wall must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 bludgeoning damage and become restrained. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, taking the same damage on a failure or freeing itself on a success.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 10 and 20 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it.

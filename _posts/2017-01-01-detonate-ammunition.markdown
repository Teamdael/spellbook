**4th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (flint and steel)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You send a mote of fire into an enemyâ€™s ammunition pouch or bandolier, triggering a massive explosion. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see within range that is carrying spare firearm ammunition. On a hit, up to 50 spare bullets or shells and all gunpowder and/or explosives that the target is carrying are instantly destroyed, and the target takes 2d10 thunder damage. All creatures within 20 feet of the target (including the target itself) must then make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

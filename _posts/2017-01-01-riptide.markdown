**3rd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a drop of water)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You create a forceful blast of water that strikes one creature or object you can see within range. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage and is either knocked prone or shoved 30 feet away from you (your choice). On a success, the target takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone or pushed. If the target is on fire, it is immediately extinguished.

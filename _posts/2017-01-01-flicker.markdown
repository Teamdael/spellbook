**3rd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (displacer beast fur, worth at least 10gp)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your body begins to flicker in and out of existence as shadow magic envelops you. For the duration of the spell, you can use your bonus action to teleport 5 feet. Additionally, when you are targeted by an attack you can use your reaction to attempt to teleport out of harm's way. Roll a d20. On a roll of 11 or higher, the attack automatically misses, and you teleport 5 feet. Otherwise, the attack hits and you teleport 5 feet shortly after.

**2nd-level chonomancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of sand from an hourglass)

**Duration**: 1 hour

This spell enchants a physical missile, such as an arrow, bolt or sling bullet so that it freezes in time and space. You may reposition the missile as part of the action to cast the spell, and the spell may be used on magical or otherwise enchanted missiles.
The missile remains frozen in place until either a creature passes within 60 feet in front of it, something touches it, a strong wind blows upon it, the enchantment is dispelled or the duration ends. At that point, the missile moves suddenly, as if it was just fired or thrown. If a creature is in the line of fire, the missile makes an attack which adds your spell attack bonus to the attack roll, and does the basic damage of whatever missile type was used (missiles that vary by launcher use the highest possible damage dice).

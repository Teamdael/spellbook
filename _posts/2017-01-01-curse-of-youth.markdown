**4th-level chronomancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a child's toy)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

This spell reverses time for a creature that you can see within range until it becomes a helpless baby. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. Shapechangers and creatures that do not experience infancy automatically succeed on this saving throw.
If the target drops to 0 hit points, it reverts back to its original age, and excess damage carries over to its normal form.
The target retains all of its game statistics except its base movement speed, hit points, and size, which are changed to 10 feet, half of the target's maximum, and one size category smaller, respectively. It cannot take any actions, bonus actions, or reactions, cannot cast spells, and cannot communicate, except by crying (a person using the spell comprehend languages or similar abilities can interpret such crying to gain a rough understanding of the baby’s emotional state). While under the effects of this spell, the target is prone and cannot stand up without the help of another creature.
The target’s gear is unaffected by this spell; it will likely fall off the target due to being vastly oversized.
A *remove curse* spell ends this curse early.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher and maintain your concentration on it for the entire possible duration, the target makes another Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is cursed to remain as a baby until a remove curse spell ends the curse. Additionally, if the target drops to 0 hit points, it does not revert to original age, and begins making death saves as normal. On a success, the effects end.

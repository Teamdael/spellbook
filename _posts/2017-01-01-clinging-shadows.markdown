**2nd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (bat fur)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You choose an area of dim light or darkness that you can see within range and that fits within a 15-foot cube. Each creature within the area must succeed on Strength saving throw or be restrained by shadows until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the shadows can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a tendril of shadow to reach out and grab a creature within 10 feet of the area. The creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pulled into the area and becomes restrained.

If the area becomes bathed in bright light, the spell has no effect until the bright light fades.

**3rd-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a tiny vial of strong liquor)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You emit a drunken aura that quickly washes away, leaving the feeling of an intense hangover. A creature you choose within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 psychic damage. The target has disadvantage on Constitution checks it makes to maintain concentration on a spell due to this damage. Additionally, the target is poisoned until the start of your next turn.

**1st-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 1 mile

**Components**: V, S, M (a feather)

**Duration**: 1 round

You point your finger in a direction and whisper a message, while specifying up to six creatures to be the targets. If a target is in range and in the approximate direction indicated, they (and only they) hear the message carried on the wind. They can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
You can cast this spell only when there is a clear path for air to move between you and the target(s). The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings, but is blocked by solid objects and areas of magical silence.

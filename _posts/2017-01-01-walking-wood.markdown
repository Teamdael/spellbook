**8th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a branch cut from one of the trees to be awakened)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You brandish the branch of a Huge or smaller plant, shouting for it to grow legs and move at your bidding. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target, along with up to 5 other Huge or smaller plants within 60 feet of it, gains an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak one language you know. The targets also gain the ability to move their limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and gain senses similar to a human's. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plants, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.
The awakened plants are charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to any of them. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creatures choose whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated them while they were charmed.

**2nd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You speak aloud, demanding a boon from one of the darkest planes. You instantly replicate the effects of a spell of 1st level from any spell list. Each time you cast this spell, roll a d20. If the result
is a 1, you are struck by an unholy force, and are reduced to 0 hit points and fail your first and second death saving throws immediately after the spell is cast. If you are struck down a second time due to this spell before you finish a long rest, you die and cannot be resurrected by a spell cast using a spell slot lower than 8th level.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the level of the spell you can replicate increases by, and the threshold, you can replicate a spell of 2nd level or lower, and the threshold for being struck down increases by 1(from 1 on a d20 to a 1 or 2 on a d20, and so on). This pattern continues until the spell is cast using a slot of 7th or higher level, where a spell of level 6 can be replicated, and you will be struck down on a roll of 6 or lower. Casting the spell at 8th or 9th level has no additional effects beyond casting it at 7th level.

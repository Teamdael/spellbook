**Conjuration cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 minute

With a flourish, you summon a number of throwing weapons equal to twice your spellcasting modifier. These weapons can be of any type: daggers, handaxes, sling bullets, darts, etc. For the duration of the spell, the summoned weapons float within easy reach, allowing you to grab and throw them with ease. As an action, you can throw one weapon as a ranged spell attack with a range of 60 feet; on a hit, the weapon deals 1d6 magical piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage as appropriate to the weapon thrown. After one hit, the weapon vanishes.

At higher levels, you can make more attacks with your weapons. At 5th level, you can make two attacks, at 11th level, three attacks, and at 17th level, four attacks.

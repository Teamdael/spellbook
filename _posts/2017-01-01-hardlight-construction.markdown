**3rd-level conjuration [futuristic]**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (an emerald ring worth at least 30 gp)

**Duration**: 10 minutes

You compress waves of light into a solid, shimmering structure composed of hardlight within range. You can create a Huge or smaller object (contained within a 15-foot cube, or 27 connected 5-foot cubes) which persists for the duration. For example, you can build a bridge crossing a chasm, a tower to see over the treeline, or a patch for the hull of a starship. This object can't have moving parts or deal damage or directly harm anyone. No matter what object you build, it has AC 10 and HP equal to 30 + your spellcasting modifier. The object collapses into nothingness and the spell ends if it is reduced to 0 hit points.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, it's HP increases by 10 per slot level above 3rd. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can use your action to change the object created into any other object you choose which fits the criteria. Doing so does not restore the object's HP.

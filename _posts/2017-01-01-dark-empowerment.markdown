**4th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You channel dark energy into yourself. For the duration, you have resistance to damage dealt by living creatures that are not fiends, celestials, or fey. Whenever you damage a living creature, you gain temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting modifier. These temporary hit points last for the duration of this spell.

A beam of tenebrous moonlight streaks from your left eye, toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage and can't take the Disengage action until the end of your next turn.

This spell creates an additional beam and deals more damage at higher levels. At 5th level, you fire a second beam originating from your right eye. Your first beam's damage increases by 1d8 (2d8) when you reach 11th level,and your second beam's damage increases by 1d8 (2d8) when you reach 17th level.

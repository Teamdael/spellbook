**Conjuration cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

With a flick of your wrist, you conjure an exploding die, which you can toss at a hostile target within range. Make a ranged spell attack roll against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 thunder damage. If you roll a 6 on any damage die, you can roll an additional d6 and add its damage to the total, rolling again if this die it also a 6, and so on. Effects which would increase the damage die size of a spell have no effect on this cantrip.

This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

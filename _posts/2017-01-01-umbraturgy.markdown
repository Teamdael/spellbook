**Transmutation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Up to 1 hour

You compel shadows to create one of the following effects at a point you can see within range:
* The shadow of a creature or object changes size or shape, up to a maximum of double or half its normal size. This effect lasts for up to 1 minute, or until it moves.
* You cause shadows to conceal a creature in dim light or darkness, giving them advantage on their next Dexterity (Stealth) check within the next minute as long as they remain in the dim light or darkness.
* A creature or objectâ€™s shape becomes either harder or softer, making its form either easier or harder to discern from the shape of the shadow. This effect lasts for up to 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

**8th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 1 mile

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Massive rocks crash to the ground at three different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere does not spread around corners. A creature takes 12d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one impact is affected only once. This spell deals double damage to objects and structures.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a 9th level spell slot, you can select a fourth 20-foot sphere to target for bombardment

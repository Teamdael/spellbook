**3rd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a snake fang)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Massive, venomous fangs spring from your mouth. Make a melee spell attack against a target within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 poison damage, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they are poisoned until the start of your next turn. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd. When you cast this spell using a slot of 5th level or higher, you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action after using your action to attack with this spell.

**5th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 150 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Until dispelled

You touch a weapon. Until the spell ends, the weapon becomes magical (if it wasnâ€™t already) and gains the following property in addition to any others it has:

**Cursed.** This weapon is cursed, and touching it extends this curse to you, unless you are a fey creature, in which case you suffer no ill effect. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all times.
Whenever you roll a 1 on an attack roll with this weapon, roll a d6 and apply the result from the table below.

|d6|Effect|
|:-:|:-|
|1|You fall prone and your turn ends immediately|
|2|You are blinded until the end of your next turn|
|3|You are deafened until the end of your next turn|
|4|You are immediately teleported 20 feet in a random direction. If you would end up within a solid obstacle, you take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and end up as close to the destination as possible|
|5|All food items within ten feet of you immediately spoil, becoming completely inedible|
|6|The weapon transforms into a live goose (or another animal chosen by the GM), which is magically bound to your hand and cannot be removed by any means (except by ending the curse). It reverts to its original form after one minute|

A *remove curse* spell ends this curse.

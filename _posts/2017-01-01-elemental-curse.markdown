**6th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A spark leaps from your finger to a creature you touch, spreading in bright cracks across its skin. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be cursed for the duration. While cursed, the target has vulnerability to your choice of acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage. If creature has resistance to the chosen damage type, it instead only loses that resistance. If the target has immunity to the chosen damage type, it is treated as having only resistance to that damage.
A *remove curse* spell ends this curse early.

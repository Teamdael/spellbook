**1st-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a dove's feather)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You wave your hand and three alabaster feathers, magically sharpened to a razor's edge, appear and orbit you. When you cast this spell, make a ranged spell attack using one of your feathers against a creature within 120 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 slashing damage. Until the spell ends, while you have feathers remaining, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st. You gain an additional 2 feathers when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher (5 feathers), and 5th level or higher (7 feathers).

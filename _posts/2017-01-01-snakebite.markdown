**Evocation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a snake fang and a vial of snake venom)

**Duration**: 1 round

Pointing with two fingers, you let loose spectral set of snake fangs in a bright green flash, which lunge at the spell's target. Make a ranged spell attack roll. On a successful a hit, the target takes 1d8 poison damage and has disadvantage for the duration on their next Constitution saving throw against being poisoned.
This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

**6th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a butterfly cocoon)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

One willing Large or smaller target of your choosing is surrounded by an opaque cocoon of force. Nothing, not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects, can pass through the cocoon, in or out, though a creature within it can breathe there. The cocoon is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the cocoon damage anything outside it. A disintegrate spell targeting the cocoon destroys it without harming anything inside it.

The cocooned creature can use a bonus action to cause the cocoon to instantly dissolve away. The creature then emerges with butterfly wings that grant it a flight speed of 80 feet for the duration. When it emerges, the creature can also choose to have a butterfly proboscis, which lasts for the spellâ€™s duration. This prevents it from speaking or performing the verbal components of spells, but grants the creature a melee bite attack that deals 4d6 necrotic damage on a hit. The creature regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt with this attack.

If the creature is in the air when the spell ends, they float gently to the ground.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, one additional creature can be affected by for each slot level above 6th.

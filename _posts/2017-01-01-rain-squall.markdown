**3rd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 150 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a rag soaked in water)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, heavy rain falls in a 40-foot-tall cylinder with a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused. Creatures in the area have resistance to fire damage, but suffer disadvantage on ranged attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on hearing.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the squall 60 feet in any direction.

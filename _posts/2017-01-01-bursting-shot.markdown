As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make an attack with a firearm, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the shot bursts, dealing thunder damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier to the target and 1d6 to each other creature within 5 feet of it.

The spellâ€™s damage to creatures other than the target increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

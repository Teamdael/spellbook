**1st-level illusion**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (60-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a mushroom)

**Duration**: 1 hour

For a moment, the colors around you shift in a rainbow swirl, before coming to rest far from their original hues. The colors of all creatures and objects you choose within range change randomly and remain brightly and unnaturally colored for the duration. Additionally, each affected creature you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

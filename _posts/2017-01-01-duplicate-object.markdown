**4th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a silver mirror)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You create an exact copy of a nonmagical, non-living object you can see within range (the copy must also appear within the spell’s range.) The object must fit inside a 5-foot cube. The copy is a real, permanent, independent object that functions exactly like the original. You can’t duplicate an object created by this spell.
If the object you wish to copy would be considered a ‘complex item’ as noted in the ***Tools of the Trade chapter of the Complete Craftmsan*** (Middle Finger of Vecna), you must be proficient in the requisite tools to duplicate it using this spell. Materials such as adamantine, coldwood, mithral, and zurkhwood count as magical for the purposes of this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the sides of the cube in which the object must fit are increased by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th, to a maximum of a 20-foot cube. Thus, when cast at 5th level, you could duplicate an object that fits in a 10-foot cube.

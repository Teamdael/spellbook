**Transmutation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. Each target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 necrotic damage as their shadows lash out at each other. If one of the creatures moves before the start of your next turn, both targets must repeat the saving throw as the shadows lash out again, dealing another 1d4 necrotic damage.

The spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

**5th-level conjuration [futuristic]**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (an emerald ring worth at least 30 gp)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Plates of shimmering compressed light swarm your body,
landing in the precise positions to form an intricate suit of
power armor. For the duration, you gain the following
benefits:
* Your AC equals 16.
* You gain 40 temporary hit points. If these temporary hit points are reduced to 0, the spell ends. If any of them remain when the spell ends, they are lost.
* Your size becomes Large, if it was smaller.
* You have advantage on Strength checks and savingthrows.
* The armor confers the benefits of a life suit
* The armor has two built-in battlefists. You have proficiency with these weapons. When you attack with them, you make a melee spell attack against a target within 10 feet of you. On a hit, the battlefists deal force damage equal to 2d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
* You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the temporary hit points bestowed by the spell increases by 10 points for each spell level above 5th

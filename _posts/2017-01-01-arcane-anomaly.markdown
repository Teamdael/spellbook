**1st-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a broken mirror)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You spread cracks in the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. For the duration, whenever a spell is cast within range, roll a d6. On a 1, the spell casting fails, expending a spell slot as normal, but not consuming material components.

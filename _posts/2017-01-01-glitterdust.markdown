**3rd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (15-foot cone)

**Components**: V, S, M (a handful of powdered mica)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You spray golden particles in a 15-foot cone, covering all creatures and objects in that area. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution save or be blinded for the duration. A creature blinded by this spell can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. An affected creature or object canâ€™t benefit from being invisible for the duration.

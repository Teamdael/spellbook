**7th-level conjuration [renaissance]**

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a replica castle figurine worth at least 100 gp)

**Duration**: 24 hours

You conjure defenses to protect up to 5,000 square feet of floor space (an area approximately 70 feet square, or two hundred 5-foot squares or fifty 10-foot squares). The protected area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can fortify several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.
When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.
Zone of fortification creates the following effects within the fortified area.
Corridors. Caltrops fill all the fortified corridors. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it can hear gunfire from one randomly-determined direction.
Ballistic Protection. You can place up to two fixed instances of the protection from ballistics spell in two locations of your choice within the fortified area.
Doors. All doors in the fortified area are magically locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition, you can replace up to ten doors with armored bulkheads that are immune to nonmagical damage and feature gunports that allow creatures adjacent to the door to make ranged attacks through them, while benefiting from full cover against anyone on the other side.
Sandbags. You can also place up to twenty-five sections of sandbags anywhere in the fortified area. Each section is five feet long and one foot thick, has 10 HP, 16 AC and is immune to all damage except thunder. The sections must be supported by solid ground and can be contiguous, but do not have to be. Sandbags confer half cover to anyone crouched behind them.
Stairs. Stairs in the fortified area are sown with ball bearings from top to bottom. These balls reappear in 10 minutes if they are dispersed while spell lasts.
The entire fortified area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.
You can create a permanently fortified structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.

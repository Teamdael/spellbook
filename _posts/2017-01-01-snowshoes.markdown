**1st-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a sprig from an evergreen tree)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You transform the footwear of yourself and your companions, enabling you all to walk easily on snow. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) can walk on snow or ice without being impeded or imperiled in any way. Furthermore, your feet do not penetrate through snow, meaning that you do not leave an obvious trail in snowy conditions.

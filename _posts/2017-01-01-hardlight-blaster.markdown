**1st-level conjuration [futuristic]**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 10 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (an emerald ring worth at least 30 gp)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You wave your hand and conjure a sophisticated arcane weapon, constructed of brilliant compressed light, which hovers in the air in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. The weapon fires a crackling beam of energy at a target you choose within 60 feet of it, making a ranged spell attack using your spell attack bonus. The weapon is the point of origin for this attack; therefore, the attack can target a creature that is not within your line of sight, as long as it is within the weaponâ€™s line of sight. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 force damage. After this attack, this weapon dissipates.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you deal an additional 1d6 force damage for each slot level above 1st.

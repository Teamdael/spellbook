**Necromancy cantrip (hemomancy)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You touch a creature and expend 1 hit point, opening a wound where you touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is below half its hit point maximum. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.

The spell's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

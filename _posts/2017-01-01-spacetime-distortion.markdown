**1st-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You warp spacetime around a creature you can see within range. An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving throw to resist this effect. Creatures within 5 feet of the target are treated as if they are 10 feet away, and creatures 10 feet away are treated as if they are 5 feet away. Moreover, other creatures can move through the target's space, as long as they do not end their movement there.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can choose to exponentially distort space around the target. Creatures 5 feet away from the target are treated as if they are 60 feet away from the target, creatures 10 feet away from the target are treated as being 5 feet away, and creatures up to 15 feet away from the target are treated as being 10 feet away. Ranged attacks against this creature have disadvantage.

**7th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, M (a copper piece, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

***Note*** In my games, I'm open for other one-word wishes than the ones listed below. Proceed with caution.

This wondrous spell has the power to grant wishes. Unfortunately, it only functions when given a vague, general sense of what the caster wants. When you cast this spell, you must speak the phrase “I wish for…” followed by one of the following words:

* ***Freedom.*** You are immune to the charmed, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, and restrained conditions for the next 8 hours.
* ***Friendship.*** The spell conjures two random beasts of CR 2 or lower, as per the conjure animals spell, cast with 5th level spell slot.
* ***Happiness.*** You automatically succeed on the next saving throw you are required to make.
* ***Health.*** You regain 10d8 hit points and are cured of any diseases and poisons you are suffering from.
* ***Knowledge.*** You learn 3 things that you didn’t know before, determined by the GM. If you are currently engaged in a quest or mission, at least one piece of information will be relevant to it.
* ***Love.*** One randomly-determined creature that you have previously met falls in love with you.
* ***Peace.*** Up to 6 creatures of your choice plus 6 creatures of the GM’s choice are placed under the effects of a sanctuary spell for the next 8 hours.
* ***Power.*** Your maximum hit points are increased by 25 for the next hour. Also, one of more of your ability scores chosen at random from the table below becomes 19 for the same duration, unless it is already higher.

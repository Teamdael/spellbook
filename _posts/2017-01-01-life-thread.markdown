**Necromancy cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 5 feet

**Components**: V, M (a red or black thread)

You create a binding thread that ties your soul to the soul of creature within 5 feet of you. If either you or the creature moves more than 5 feet away from the other, the creature that moved takes 1d12 necrotic damage.

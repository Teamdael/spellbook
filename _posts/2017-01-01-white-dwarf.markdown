**8th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 1 mile

**Components**: V, S, M (a pair of spectacles made from darkened glass)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to an hour

A brilliant 20-foot radius artificial star, complete with its own solar heat and gravitational pull, appears at an unoccupied location you choose within range. When you cast this spell, you can choose any number of creatures to be unaffected by it while they are further than 30 feet from the star.
Any creature that comes within 120 feet of the star for first time on a turn or starts its turn there, must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature within 30 feet of the star automatically fails this save. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d12 radiant damage, or half as much on a successful save.
If a creature comes within 30 feet of the star for first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet closer to the star by its gravitational pull. Medium or smaller objects weighing less than 2,000 pounds in this area that aren't being worn or carried are pulled into the star. If a creature or object touches the star, it takes 8d12 fire damage plus 8d12 radiant damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn.
The star sheds bright light in a 1-mile radius sphere and dim light for an additional mile. If any of this star's bright light overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 8th level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.

**2nd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Special

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Special

You draw upon the power of raw chaos to create unpredictable effects. This spell duplicates the effects of a 1st-level spell of your choice from your classâ€™ spell list. Any material components required for the spell appear magically in your hands when you cast the dweomer, only to disappear once they have been used. The effects of the spell are then applied instantly.

After you cast this spell, you must immediately roll on the Weird Arcana table, found in the *Fey Folio by Vecna*.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the potential set of spells that can be duplicated expands to include all of those up to one level lower than the slot from which the dweomer is cast, up to a maximum of 5th. There is no additional benefit from casting the dweomer at 7th level or higher. The spell then counts as being cast at the level that was used for the dweomer minus one, also to a maximum of 5th level.

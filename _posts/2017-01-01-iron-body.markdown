**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a bar of steel-adamantium alloy worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: 8 hours

This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as iron. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.

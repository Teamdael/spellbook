**5th-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (candies, cookies, and cakes worth at least 10gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: 8 hours

This spell conjures a small cottage made from bread centered on a point you can see within range. You determine the floorplan of the cottage, though it must fit within a 15-by-15-foot footprint, and may have no more than one story and one door. The interior is comfortably appointed, and up to six people may rest inside (if there are more occupants, it becomes too cramped to allow resting).

The walls of the cottage are magically reinforced and cannot be destroyed except by a dispel magic or disintegrate spell. The door has a mundane lock (DC 15 to pick). You can place windows in any of the exterior walls, allowing those inside to see out and those outside to see in. Ranged attacks can be made through windows.

Everything inside the cottage is made out of gingerbread and other sweet treats. There are enough nonessential elements to feed up to six creatures, which gain the following benefits after spending 10 minutes eating in the cottage: the creature is freed from any charm affecting it and is immune the charmed condition. Its hit point maximum increases by 2d6 and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for the next 8 hours.

**2nd-level conjuration (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (an abacus)

**Duration**: 8 hours

This spell creates an invisible, shapeless force that performs intellectual tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, an Intelligence of 12, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The accountant can perform intellectual tasks that a human clerk could do, such as assaying prices, updating accounts, managing inventories or computing interest. Once you give the command, the accountant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command. The accountant can perform no physical labor and is not able to lift any object heavier than a bottle of ink.
If you command the accountant to perform a task that would move it more than 300 feet away from you, the spell ends.

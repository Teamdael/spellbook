**7th-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self, (40-foot-radius sphere)

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of wet gunpowder)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

An invisible 40-foot-radius field of magic extends from you, disrupting bullets and causing firearms to malfunction. Within the sphere, attacks with firearms fail, and firearms used to make an attack immediately jam. A jammed firearm can't be used to make an attack until a creature uses its action to clear the weapon malfunction.

Firearms outside the sphere which are fired into it have disadvantage on attack rolls and deal only half damage on a successful hit.

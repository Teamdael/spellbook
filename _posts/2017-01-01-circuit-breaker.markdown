**2nd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you are damaged by a creature you can see within 5 feet of you

**Range**: Self (5-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You let out a burst of electricity, shocking those nearby and temporarily overloading devices. Each creature within 5 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d8 lightning damage, or half as much on a successful save. Each piece of magical technology within range is also disabled until the end of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

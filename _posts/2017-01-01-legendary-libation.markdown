**Conjuration cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, M (a container, such as a mug, tankard, or flask, which is filled with liquid that is purified by the spell)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

***NOTE:*** Unsure if I should allow this spell, as it is a cantrip that essentially takes the place of something like *create water*.

You speak a word of power and your container fills with a drink of your choosing, which can be imbibed as an action. The drink is delicious and satisfies the drinker's thirst for the next 24 hours. Furthermore, the drinker has advantage on saving throws against becoming frightened for one hour after consuming this libation. If the drink is not consumed within one hour of being conjured, it loses its magic and turns into mundane, flavorless water. A creature cannot benefit from more than one legendary libation in any given 24-hour period.

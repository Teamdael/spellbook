**2nd-level conjuration [renaissance]**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 300 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a vial of seawater)

**Duration**: 24 hours

You create an iceberg that is up to 25 feet in any dimension centered on a point of water within range. You decide the iceberg’s shape within these dimensions. The iceberg is an object with an AC of 12 and 100 hit points. The lowermost 80 percent of it is submerged as it floats. At the end of the spell’s duration, the iceberg melts back into water.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can move the iceberg up to 50 feet in any direction you choose. If the iceberg collides with a ship or other object of Huge size or larger, both objects take 4d10 bludgeoning damage. If the object is a ship, it gains 1d4 leaks.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, for each slot level above 2nd, each of the following changes take place:
* The iceberg’s AC increases by 2.
* Its hit points increase by 20.
* Its maximum size in any dimension increase by 25 feet.
* The damage dealt when colliding with an object increases by 1d10.

**4th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a handful of iron or copper filings)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You touch a metal object of Medium size or smaller or a section of metal no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a bar of metal into a weapon, idol, or tool, or make a small passage through a portcullis, as long as the metal is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a metal door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible. This spell cannot affect magical metals such as adamantine and mithral.

**4th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a small servant's bell)

**Duration**: Special

After spending the casting time singing a song, you touch a Small or smaller beast. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The beast then transforms into a humanoid of your choosing. All of the creature’s abilities scores are changed to 10. The humanoid is of a friendly disposition to you. has a basic understanding of all simple unskilled labors, and can understand the languages you speak, but does not speak themselves. The footman has proficiency in any trade, craft, or profession you have proficiency in and uses your proficiency bonus. Additionally, upon transformation, the animal is clothed in mundane clothing of your choosing with a nominal value no greater than 10 gp (though this clothing cannot be removed from their body for the duration of the spell).

You can instruct the humanoid to do anything that is reasonably within their capability and is not obviously dangerous. They behave as though they are dutifully employed by you. 

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The humanoid form has 4 (1d8) hit points. When it reverts to its true form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its true form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. This spell’s duration varies depending upon when and where it was cast. If cast in a location where time passes normally, the spell lasts until the twelfth stroke of the next midnight, however long that may be. Elsewhere, the spell lasts for 24 hours.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can transform one additional animal for each spell slot above 4th

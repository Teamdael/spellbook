**4th-level necromancy (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (two nails from a coffin)

**Duration**: 24 hours

This spell forges a mortal connection between yourself and a creature that you touch. A target creature must be present for the entire time of casting. If the creature is unwilling, it must make a Constitution saving throw to resist the spell's effects.
For the duration, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, the target is also reduced to 0 hit points, and vice versa. This spell ends if you cast it again, or if you choose to dismiss it as an action.

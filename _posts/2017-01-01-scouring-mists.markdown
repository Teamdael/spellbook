**3rd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a handful of white phosphorous)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

With a gesture, you fling 4 waves of the Dead Mist at targets within range, rending their flesh from their bones. You may fire them at one target or several. A target must make a Dexterity saving throw for each wave they are targeted with. A target takes 3d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one.
When you cast this spell, you take 1d8 necrotic damage for each wave you launch. This damage ignores damage resistance and damage immunity.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can fling an additional wave per slot level above 3rd.

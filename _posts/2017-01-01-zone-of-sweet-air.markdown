**2nd-level abjuration (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a silk handkerchief)

**Duration**: 10 Minutes

You create an invisible magical zone that eliminates noxious airs in a 15-foot radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range.
All poisonous or otherwise damaging gases of natural or magical origin, except those created by breath weapons, are blocked by this spell and cannot enter the zone. Fresh air passes into the zone without hindrance. If any fumes are present when the spell was cast, or are created inside the area of protection, they are instantaneously purged from it.

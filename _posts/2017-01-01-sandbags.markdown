**1st-level conjuration (ritual) [renaissance]**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: 10 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a duck figurine)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a low wall of sandbags, a perfect source of cover, at a point you can see within range. The wall is 18 inches thick and is composed of three 5-foot-long-by-3-foot-high segments. Each segment must be contagious with at least one other segment.

A Medium creature that hunkers behind the sandbag wall has half cover from ranged attacks and a Small creature that hunkers behind it has three-quarters cover from ranged attacks. A prone creature has full cover behind the wall. The wall can be leapt over the wall without using any additional movement.

The sandbag is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. Each segment has AC 10 and 120 hit points. Reducing a segment of the wall to 0 hit points causes it to crumble, destroying it. Once summoned, the sandbags from the wall can be removed from the wall or rearranged into a different configuration. The wall and all its sandbags disappear when the spell ends.

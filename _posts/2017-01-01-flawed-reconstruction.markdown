**1st-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a needle and thread)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You stitch together the wounds of a creature you touch, which regains 4d6 hit points. However, the mending is imperfect, and the target's maximum hit points is decreased by the same amount until it finishes a long rest. A creature that regains hit points due to this spell will be left with some permanent scars.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

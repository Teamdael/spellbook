**7th-level necromancy (hemomancy)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a poison or venom)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You infect a portion of your blood and splash it on creatures within range. As you cast this spell, you must expend a number of hit points, allowing you to target 1 creature for every 5 hit points spent. Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 6d8 necrotic damage and is also infected for the duration. On a success, the target takes half damage and suffers no additional effect. An infected target is poisoned, canâ€™t regain hit points, and whenever they take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, they take an additional 2d8 necrotic damage as they bleed profusely. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns to end the effect.

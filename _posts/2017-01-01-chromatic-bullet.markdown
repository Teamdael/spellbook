**1st-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a firearm)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make an attack with a firearm, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects and takes an additional 1d4 damage. You can choose for the weaponâ€™s damage, as well as this additional damage, to be either acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage. You do not need to pick the same type for both, and you can leave the weapon damage as whatever type would normally be dealt by the weapon.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.

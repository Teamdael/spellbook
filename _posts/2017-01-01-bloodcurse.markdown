**5th-level necromancy (hemomancy)**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: S

**Duration**: Varies (see below)

You touch a creature’s open wound and bestow a curse. As you expend a number of hit points to cast the spell, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. During the casting of the spell, you can make a Charisma (Deception) check against the target’s Wisdom (Insight) check to attempt to conceal  the spell’s true nature, such as pretending to bandage their wound.

For the duration of the curse, which is a number of days equal to the amount of hit points spent, the creature can’t regain hit points and is poisoned. When the creature completes a long rest, they take 4d10 necrotic damage as the curse rots away at them.

A *remove curse* spell ends this effect.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.

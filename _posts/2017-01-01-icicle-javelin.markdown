**1st-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a small icicle)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You fling a massive icicle toward a target of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 cold damage. If the target is adjacent to a wall or a similar large, immobile object, it may be pinned to that surface on its next turn. At the beginning of the target's next turn, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it has a speed of 0 until the end of its turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

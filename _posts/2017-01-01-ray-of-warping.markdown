**3rd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A sapphire beam leaps forth from your fingertips, twisting and contorting the form of a creature it touches. Make a ranged spell attack roll against a target you can see within range. On a hit, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage, and for the duration, its speed is halved and its highest ability score is reduced to be the same as its lowest ability score (to a minimum of 3). If two or more of the creature’s ability scores are tied for highest, you choose which ability score is reduced. The creature also has disadvantage on saving throws with its lowest ability
scores. On its turn, the target can use its action to make a Constitution saving throw, ending this spell on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d8 per slot level above 3rd. Additionally, if you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the creature’s second highest ability score is also reduced to be the same as its lowest ability score.

**2nd-level evocation [renaissance]**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you make an attack with a firearm attack 1before this spell ends, the shot is accelerated to an incredible velocity. Instead of making an attack roll against a single target, the shot becomes a 5-foot-wide line that extends from you out to the weapon’s normal range. All creatures in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the weapon’s normal damage on a failure or half as much damage on a successful one.

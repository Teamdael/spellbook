**5th-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 10 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Until dispelled

Opening your palm, you release a puff of dust, the pestilence of mummy rot. Choose one creature within range to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can’t44 magehandpress.com regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or any other spell or magical effect that cures mummy rot.

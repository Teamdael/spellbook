**2nd-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 100gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: Until dispelled

This spell, based on the alarm and glyph of warding spells, is used to discourage theft by triggering an alarm when an item is removed from a location. It comes in two versions: one that is cast on an aperture, and one that is cast on an object.

**Aperture.** You spend ten minutes inscribing invisible glyphs on an aperture such as a door, gate, window or archway no larger than 10 square feet. Whenever an object bearing an alarm glyph passes through the warded area, it produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 120 feet. Casting the knock spell on the aperture suppresses the effect for 10 minutes.

**Object.** You spend ten minutes inscribing an invisible glyph on an object. This object will now trigger any alarmed apertures through which it passes.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast the aperture version of this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can store one spell of 2nd level or lower (usually hold person) inside it. This spell must target be capable of targeting a creature, object, or area and you must expend the appropriate spell slot and spell components when the spell is stored. This stored spell is then cast and expended the first time the alarm is triggered. If the triggering object is being worn or carried, the stored spell targets whoever is carrying it or the location where they are standing. If not, it targets the object directly. Once it has been expended, the stored spell can be re-activated (or changed to a different spell) by touching the glyph and expending another spell slot and spell components.

**2nd-level necromancy (hemomancy)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause the corpse of a creature to explode into a burst of necrotic energy. Choose a corpse within range. The creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to black dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a reincarnate, true resurrection, or a wish spell. Each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d8 necrotic damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

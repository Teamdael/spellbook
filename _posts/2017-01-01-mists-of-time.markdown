**9th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You throw caution to the wind and wrap yourself in the Mists of R'leyh, imposing a shadow of the past on your mind and body. You regain 4 spell slots of 5th level or lower.

When you cast this spell, you can choose to drink deeply from the Dead Mists and take necrotic damage equal to half your current hit points. This damage ignores both damage resistance and damage immunity. If you do so, you regain the expended uses of up to three abilities which normally recover when you take a rest.

Once you cast this spell, you cannot cast it again for 24 hours, even if you have an available 9th level spell slot.

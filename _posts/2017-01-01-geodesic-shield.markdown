**2nd-level conjuration [futuristic]**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Translucent, triangular plates of force assemble to form a 15-foot radius spherical dome around you, centered on a point you touch. The dome contains clean, breathable air, and airborne substances, such as poisonous gas, smoke, or fog can't penetrate within it. The dome insulates those inside it from extreme temperatures, regardless of the outside environment. Creatures can walk freely into or out of the dome, but the dome blocks ranged attacks, spells, and other effects. The dome has AC 10 and 20 HP. The spell ends when the dome is reduced to 0 HP.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the dome's AC increases by 1 and its HP increases by 10 for each spell level above 2nd.

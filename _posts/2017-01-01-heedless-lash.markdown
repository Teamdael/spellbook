**1st-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You conjure forth a glowing, white tendril formed of the Dead Mists of R'lyeh, which lashes out at a foe, but also wracks you with pain. Make a ranged spell attack roll against a creature within range; if you hit, the target takes 4d8 necrotic damage. You take 1d8 necrotic damage when you cast this spell. This damage ignores both damage resistance and damage immunity.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage to your target increases by 2d8 and the damage to yourself increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

**1st-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (the end of an octopus tentacle)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You sprout grotesque, whipping tendrils which automatically attack nearby creatures. When a creature comes within 5 feet of you or begins its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

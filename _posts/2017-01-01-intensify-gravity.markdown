**4th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell intensifies gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in this area must spend two feet of movement for every foot moved, including flying, jumping, and climbing movement. This can be combined with difficult terrain to slow movement to a quarter of normal speed. If a prone creature wishes to stand up, it must succeed on a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a failure, it can’t move at all on its turn.

Objects in the area, including those being worn or carried, weigh double their usual weight, which therefore may cause creatures to become encumbered or cause loadbearing spells like levitate to fail. Any ranged weapon attacks that pass into, out of, or through the area have disadvantage and any falling damage dealt within the spell’s area is doubled.

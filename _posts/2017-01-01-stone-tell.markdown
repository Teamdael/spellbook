**2nd-level divination**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 10 minutes

You touch a Large or smaller piece of natural rock or worked stone and imbue it with limited sentience and animation, giving it the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. If you touch a larger piece of stone, a 10-foot-square section of it is affected. You can question rocks about events in their area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, things that have been said, and other circumstances.
If cast on a stone door or chest, you can use your action to command the object to open, close, lock or unlock.
If cast on an earth elemental or stone-based construct, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.
This spell can cause spikes created by the spike growth spell to recede around a creature you specify, granting them immunity to that effect.

**2nd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (20-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

When you cast this spell, glowing white tendrils of smoke reach up from the ground in a 20-foot radius area around the point where you stand. When a creature other than you enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be grappled by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature other than you that starts its turn in the area and is already grappled by the tentacles can make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a failure, it can't take actions or reactions until the start of its next turn. On a success, it frees itself.

When you cast this spell, you take 2d8 necrotic damage, and you take an additional 1d8 necrotic damage at the end of each round you concentrate on it. This damage ignores both damage resistance and damage immunity.

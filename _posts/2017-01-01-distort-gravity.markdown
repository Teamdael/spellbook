**4th-level transmutation (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a gyroscope)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

This spell changes the direction of gravity within a 60-foot square area on surface you touch. The affected area can wrap around a surface, if its geometry permits. For the duration, creatures and objects within 15 feet of the surface fall toward it as if it were the ground. A creature can walk on this surface as if it were level ground, even if the surface is perpendicular to the ground or upside down. When the duration ends, all creatures and objects fall from the surface.

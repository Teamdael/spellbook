**2nd-level illusion**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 hour

You make a creature that you touch look and sound completely unfamiliar. You don't decide the exact nature of these changes. Instead, the creature's appearance, including its clothing, armor, weapons, and belongings, change to seem completely unremarkable to anyone that sees it. For example, if the target is present at a royal ball, it might appear as a well-dressed nobleman, or if the target is walking among a group of orc mercenaries, it might appear as a typical orc warrior.
Different creatures may perceive different changes wrought by this spell. If two creatures that have seen the target discuss its appearance or voice in detail, they can discern that it is disguised with a successful Intelligence (Insight) check against your spell save DC.

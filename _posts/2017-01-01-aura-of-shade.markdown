**1st-level illusion**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a deep black onyx worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 10-foot radius sphere of shadow magic centered on a point within range. The sphere appears to be an area of swirling shadows and darkness, and is easily identifiable when it is in anarea of bright or dim light. The sphere spreads around corners, and each creature within the radius becomes invisible at the start of each of their turns. This invisibility ends if they attack, cast a spell, or leave the area. Anything they are wearing or carrying is also invisible as long as they are.

**1st-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A dizzying ring of sparks launches from your outstretched hand and returns to it moments later. Make a ranged spell attack roll against a creature within range. On a hit, you deal 3d6 radiant damage. If this attack misses, you can repeat the attack roll against the same target once.
**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

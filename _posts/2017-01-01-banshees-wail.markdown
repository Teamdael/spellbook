**6th-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a strand of banshee hair, worth at least 25 gp)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You release a mournful wail that pierces into the mind of those that hear it. Each creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 psychic damage, and falls unconscious. On a success, it takes half damage and suffers no other effect. An unconscious creature wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake them awake. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

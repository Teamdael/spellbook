**3rd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You trace in the air the insidious symbol from Lost Carcosa, the yellow sign, where it hangs for a long moment in a sickening yellow light. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of the sign must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 psychic damage, or half as much on a successful save. Aberrations take no damage from this spell. The sign fades at the end of your turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the yellow sign lingers longer in the air. The duration of this spell increases by one round for each slot level above 3rd and requires that you maintain concentration on it. If this spell is active at the beginning on your turn, you can use your action to cause each creature within range to make another saving throw against it, taking damage as normal on a failed save.

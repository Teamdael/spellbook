**Transmutation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a tiny diamond worth at least 1 gp)

**Duration**: 1 minute

The edge of a slashing or piercing weapon you are holding is magically sharpened. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon deals double damage to objects and structures. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isnâ€™t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.

**8th-level necromancy (hemomancy)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell dominates the minds and bodies of humanoids, consuming them in a frenzy of death and destruction. As you cast the spell, you must expend a number of hit points. Roll 14d8 and add double the number of hit points expended to the roll; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect.

Humanoids within 30 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures). Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is under your control until the spell ends. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. Creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell.

On each of your turns, you can issue commands to the creatures under your control, directing them where to move and attack. If a creature doesn’t receive orders from you, they attack the closest creature to them. If a creature hasn’t made an attack by the end of their turn, the spell ends for them. If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, each creature that is still under the spell’s effect when the spell ends dies.

**1st-level necromancy (hemomancy)**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You inflict a burning pain upon yourself, causing another creature that you can see within range to feel an even more excruciating pain as their blood boils. As you cast the spell, you must expend a number of hit points. The creature must then make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 + the number of hit points spent as fire damage, and immediately falls prone as they become wracked with pain. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesnâ€™t fall prone.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

**6th-level chronomancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (any device capable of telling the time)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You step out of the normal flow of time, and remain there for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. While dislocated in time, you can see and be seen by creatures and objects that remain in normal time, but everything there looks grey to you; likewise, you appear blurred and indistinct to those in normal time. You can't be affected by creatures and effects which originate in the normal flow of time. You also ignore objects in the normal flow of time, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from. Likewise, nothing you do can have any effect on normal time.

**4th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a silver pin)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You create a flash of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice that you can see within range. Two bolts then leap from that target to as many as two other targets (total, not each), each of which must be within 20 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts. A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. taking 4d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, one additional bolt leaps from the first target to another target for every two slot levels above 4th.

**9th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You utter a word of extreme and terrible power that can completely destroy one creature, object or creation of magical force you can see within range. If the creature or object you choose has 150 hit points or fewer, it dies or is destroyed. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

When killed by this spell, a creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine grey dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Huge or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Gargantuan or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 15-foot-cube portion of it. Magic items are unaffected by this spell. Regardless of whether this spell has any effect on the target, the amount of energy required to cast it is immense, and very harmful to the caster. When you cast this spell, you take 10d6 psychic damage, which cannot be avoided or resisted in any way.

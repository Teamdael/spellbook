**3rd-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A red haze clouds the eyes of a creature that meets your gaze. Choose one creature you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is cursed for the duration. A cursed target can see normally out to 5 feet, but is blind beyond this radius. A *remove curse* spell ends this curse early.

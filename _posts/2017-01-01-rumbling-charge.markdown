**1st-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a lump of granite)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You imbue yourself with the elemental power of a landslide. When you cast this spell, you immediately move 30 feet in a straight line. If your path is blocked by a creature or object, you stop moving there and that creature or object must make a Strength saving throw or take 2d12 bludgeoning damage, or half as much on a successful save.

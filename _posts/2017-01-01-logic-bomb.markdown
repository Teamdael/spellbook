**4th-level enchantment [futuristic]**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a component from a construct core)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Circuits of arcane energy reach out from your fingertips and embed themselves in nearby technology, afflicting everything it touches with a magical virus. Unattended magical technology you choose within range is disabled for the duration. Each creature you choose that is wearing or carrying magical technology (or has embedded or integrated technology on their person) must make an Intelligence (Technology) check against your spell save DC at the beginning of each of its turns or be unable to use this technology. On a successful save, the spell ends for this target.

Each construct you choose within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is incapacitated, even if it would otherwise be immune to being incapacitated, and its speed is reduced to 0 for the duration. At the beginning of each of its turns, a construct can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

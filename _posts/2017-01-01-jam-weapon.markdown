**2nd-level transmutation [renaissance]**

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when a creature you can see within range attacks with a firearm

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of wet gunpowder)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

The loaded firearm you can see jams upon firing. The attack fails, and the firearm is jammed. A jammed firearm can't be used to make an attack until a creature uses its action to clear the weapon malfunction.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional firearm within range for each slot level above 2nd.

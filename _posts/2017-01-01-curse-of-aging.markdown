**4th-level chronomancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Until dispelled

A creature you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed to age and wither. While cursed, the target ages at twice their normal rate, becoming two days older for every day that passes. In addition, it has disadvantage on all Strength checks and saving throws.
A *remove curse* spell ends this curse.
